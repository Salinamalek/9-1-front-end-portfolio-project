# Frontend Portfolio Project


### User Stories

- As a user, when I visit the website, I see a links to multiple pages in order to navigate from one page to the other.

- As a user, I can click on an About link that will navigate to a new page where I see information about the developer.

- As a user, information about objects is retrieved from an API so that I can see a list of information absed on those objects when I submit an input (objects = pokemon in this case and input = numbers).

- As a user, I can type in an input box and search for an object based on the input, (e.g. pokemon dex numbers) so that new photos (sprites) will appear based on that input as well as specific information.

- As a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the input box, I see a message on the screen notifying me to enter a value to search (I cannot submit without entering a value).

- As a user, I can click on a photo (sprite) so that I can view the front and back of the object.

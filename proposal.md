### User Stories

*As a user, when I visit the website, I see a links to multiple pages in order to navigate from one page to the other.
*As a user, I can click on an About link that will navigate to a new page where I see information about the developer.
*As a user, information about objects is retrieved from an API so that I can see a list of objects to click on (objects = pokemon in this case).
*As a user, I can type in an input box and search for an object based on the input, (e.g. pokemon) so that a new stream of photos (sprites) will appear based on that theme.
As a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the input box, I see a message on the screen notifying me to enter a value to search (I cannot submit without entering a value).
*As a user, I can click on a photo (sprite) so that I can view information about that photo (sprite).

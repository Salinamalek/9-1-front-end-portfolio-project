    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

    <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>

    <p class="text">
        Hey there stranger 👋! My name is <strong>Salina</strong> (pronounced like 'Selena' <i>(suh-lee-na)</i> and I am currently a fellow at Pursuit, studying to become a Fullstack web developer 💻! 
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
        I've always been a huge Pokémon fan and in celebration of the new Pokémon game being released in November, I decided to dedicate my <u><i>first</i></u> (yes, first!) Frontend Portfolio Project to something Pokémon-themed. I hope you can enjoy what I have displayed here 🤍! It may not seem like much, but as my first portfolio project, I'm extremely proud of my work. I can't wait to see how much I'll improve in future 🔮!

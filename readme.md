The purpose of this project is to act similarly to a Pokédex from the Pokémon games. Based on the Pokédex entry number, user will receive the name and other quick information about the specific Pokémon.

Here is the link to my deployed site:
https://salinamalek.github.io/9-1-front-end-portfolio-project/

To view a better version of the portfolio project:
-   Fork and clone this respository.
-   Open up the respository in VSCode.
-   Download the Go Live extension on VSCode.
-   Click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom of VSCode to open to the HTML page.
-   On this HTML page, navigate to the form box and enter a numerical value (pokédex entry number) into the form box (ranging from 1-898).
- Submit by clicking "Get Pokémon".
- User should receive the images/sprites of the pokémon that corresponds to the pokédex entry number.
- The images/sprites are the default version and the shiny version of the same pokémon.
- These images/sprites can be clicked to show the back view of the pokémon.
- User should also receive information about the pokémon, such as name, type(s), generation, base experience, height, and weight.
- Entering nothing into the form box and submitting will result in an error message telling user to submit a valid number.

- Note: The pokédex entry range is limited up to generation 8 of Pokémon, which is the Pokemon Sword & Shield game, and some information from the API used (Poke API) isn't updated to the current Pokemon games.
